# Research

Here is a topical look at some of my past and current research and corresponding open source projects. I will try to keep this updated, but my most up to date list for publications/work can be found on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PX-zoAMAAAAJ&hl=en).


## Current Projects

- **Decentralized Differential Game Solvers**  
  Developing fast, scalable algorithms for solving multiplayer differential games in a decentralized manner. 

- **Trajectory Design in the Cislunar CR3BP**  
  Investigating rendezvous strategies, two-point boundary value problems, and robust guidance in the circular restricted three-body problem.
